                  Creating and developing a 2-bit addition calculator meant that I had to account for a carry-out bit
                  when
                  adding single-bit number values. This was done with a half-adder that had an output
                  for the carry-out value. This also meant that when the second addition occurred for the second-bit
                  values, I had to account for the possible carry-in value that could exist if there was a
                  carry-out in the single-bit addition. The figure above depicts the full adder that takes into account
                  the possibility of a carry-in input. The figure to the right showcases the utilization of both logical
                  circuits to create the circuit block that makes up the 2-bit calculator. This full implementation

                <h3>Reflection On Discussion Questions</h3>
                <p class="margin-top-30">
                  Before the in-depth discussions we had in class, I would have only labeled laptops, desktops, and
                  phones as computers. Yes, I would have made
                  caveats to certain things depending on their components, but I had a much more narrow criterion for
                  what constitutes a computer.
                  However, the in-class questions like, “Is a broken computer still a computer?” and “Is a discharged or
                  turned-off computer still a computer?”
                  made me think much more about what makes a computer a computer. I recall making the analogy of a
                  broken car to a broken computer.
                  Specifically, I made the point that if something is broken, it does not take away the original use it
                  served (such as being a car that could be driven around).
                  There was a slippery slope I encountered where we could not determine the threshold for what could be
                  broken and still be considered a broken computer.
                  I do recall that Joe brought up the concept of a pile of sand, where we reach a conceptual breakdown
                  of how much you can remove until it no longer is a “pile” of sand.
                  We can make endless criteria for those situations, and they break down what I argued for in the
                  question.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  Considering the same question, I recall Hudson's argument, which focused on simply adding descriptors
                  to objects. The central claim in his response
                  was that if, at one point, an object served a certain purpose, it could still retain that object's
                  name. Fundamentally, he argued that if a computer worked as
                  a computer at some point, then it would still be labeled a computer with an additional descriptor to
                  portray its current state.
                  Therefore, if a computer worked at some point but is now broken, then we simply call it a broken
                  computer to describe it.
                  However, this opened the door to how we generate criteria for objects based on their utility to us.
                  This led to the question, “Does a computer need to be used by, or have the capacity to be used by,
                  humans?” in our next discussion.
                  We reached a general consensus in class that the utility of a computer is essential to its definition.
                  Humans coined the terminology and the foundation of what we consider computers today; therefore, it
                  must be that they have some utility for us.
                  If they are unusable, then they serve no purpose to us and would not be categorized as a computer
                  within our conception and description of a computer.
                  This made me think back on the possibilities of non-physical objects being considered computers,
                  considering they could still be utilized by us.

                <h3>Reflection On Readings</h3>
                <p>
                  I have always imagined computers to be inanimate in nature, and this includes all of their components
                  as well.
                  Hence, the research paper titled “Integrating Living Organisms in Devices to Implement Care-based
                  Interactions”
                  by Jasmine Lu and Pedro Lopes (Lu & Lopes, 2022) was a little concerning in its implications.
                  I do recall what a Tamagotchi was, and I had similar games growing up that relied on nurturing digital
                  creatures to achieve some goal
                  or generate affection from me to further interact with the creature or app.
                  However, at the end of the day, I knew the creature was not real and eventually became bored or moved
                  on from the game itself.
                  There was no harm to the creature since it was digital and inanimate, but this paper introduces the
                  idea of introducing a living organism into computers
                  to ensure prolonged interaction between the user and device.
                  The experiment utilized a slime mold in a heart rate sensor, anchoring the user to nurture the mold so
                  that the device could perform its function.
                  While I do not believe there is any ill intent in the nature of the experiment, I do believe that it
                  could have detrimental implications
                  if we are to assume that living organisms can be used as components for computers.
                  The slime mold has adapted to poor conditions and thus is very forgiving if users forget or simply
                  ignore taking care of it.
                  This is not true for all living organisms, so I doubt there are any larger applications where this
                  could ensure user interaction.
                  Furthermore, using other living organisms seems morally wrong if they possess autonomy that can be
                  constrained or stripped.
                  While I do think the paper provided an interesting application of employing human empathy to generate
                  user interaction with devices,
                  I do not think the larger implications or use of it are entirely good in nature.

                  <br>
                  My previous work with logical operators in both Math of CS and Math Structures made me recall much
                  about the complexity
                  and usage of logical operators for propositions. This class made me question the idea of placing these
                  operators and
                  propositions in the same category as a computer. I would have previously denied this claim, but
                  articles such as
                  “Robust Soldier Crab Ball Gate” (Gunji, Nishiyama, & Adamatzky, 2011) swayed me into believing that
                  these logical
                  operands and propositions
                  are the basis of computers. There are more nuances to this idea, and a catalyst has to be present so
                  that the operations
                  can be performed (in computers, this is electricity). The use of crabs as a source for this catalyst
                  made me analyze my
                  preconception of what a computer was. At its core, computers have logic gates that can perform
                  propositions to reach
                  answers. This is where my previous conception of the physicality of computers was altered, and I
                  realized that the
                  calculators we made are also essentially computers, albeit very simple and concise in their purpose.

                <h3>Lingering Questions</h3>
                <p class="margin-top-30">
                  I'm still curious what the classes opinion is on computers with living organisms. What ethical and
                  moral implications
                  does it bring to the criteria that make up a computer?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What utility defines a computer? Could something like an Abacus count as a computer? Or is it simply a
                  tool.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Should we take into consideration what powers the computer itself as well? If that is the case, are
                  tools like the abacus
                  I mentioned solely tools because they require us to power them?
